### Unit 1
Dear Nick, 
$\quad\quad$I'm glad you didn't  keep your stress to yourself. Just like you and me, many other students suffer from great stress too. I want to share my opinions with you. 
$\quad\quad$First, you needn't put too much stress on yourself. You will be better and better as long as you keep hard-working. Sometimes relaxation, such as listening to the music or playing some sports,  can take an important part in your study. 
$\quad\quad$Second, you should make a plan that suits you. Once you begin to learn, you should settle down and focus on what you are learning for. Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
$\quad\quad$Third, confident will bring in good grades. If you feel very nervous now, please do a deep breathing and just try your best!
$\quad\quad$Best Wishes!

$\quad\quad$I'm glad to receive your e-mail. You said that you are interested in traditional Chinese festivals. Today is Dragon Boat Festival, so let me introduce it to you.
$\quad\quad$The Dragon Boat festival is in memory of a Chinese great poet named QY. He was extolled as one of the founder of Chinese romantic poetry school. 
$\quad\quad$At Dragon Boat Festival, Chinese people will eat a traditional Chinese food named zongzi. It made of rice, peanut, beans, jujube and so on. Children often eat them with sugar because they love sweet. Adults will drink XiongHuang wine. In ancient times, this drink was considered to have the effect to eliminating bad things.
$\quad\quad$Dragon Boat race is also a traditional activity on Dragon Boat Festival. One man stood at the bow of the boat and drummed, while the others pulled together and rowed. How exciting!
$\quad\quad$Nowadays, Dragon Boat Festival has become more and more popular. Many foreign people fall in love with this great festival, they even to some research on it.
$\quad\quad$ What do you think of the Dragon Boat Festival? Looking forward to your reply.
